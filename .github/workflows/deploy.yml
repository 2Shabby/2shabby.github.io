# GitHub Pages Deployment Workflow
# 
# This workflow is OPTIONAL. GitHub Pages works without it for static sites.
# Enable this workflow if you want:
#   - Automated deployment on push
#   - Build step validation
#   - Custom domain handling
#
# To enable:
#   1. Rename this file to deploy.yml (remove .disabled if present)
#   2. Go to repo Settings > Pages > Source > GitHub Actions
#   3. Push to main/master branch
