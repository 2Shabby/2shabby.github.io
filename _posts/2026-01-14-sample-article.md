> **TODO:** This is a template file demonstrating the article structure. Replace this entire file with your actual content, or delete it once you've created your first real post.

This placeholder shows where your opening paragraphs appear. On the Writing page, readers see everything above the `<!--more-->` separator—typically 2-3 paragraphs that set up your topic and hook the reader.

<!--more-->

## Template Instructions

**To create a real article:**

1. Create a new file in `_posts/` named `YYYY-MM-DD-your-title.md`
2. Copy the frontmatter structure (title, date, tags, description)
3. Write your opening paragraphs before `<!--more-->`
4. Continue with the full article after the separator
5. Delete this template file

**Frontmatter options:**

```yaml
