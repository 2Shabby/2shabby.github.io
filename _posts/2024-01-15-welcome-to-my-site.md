Welcome to my new website! I'm excited to share this space with you.

## About This Site

This site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator that works seamlessly with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). It's designed to be:

- **Fast** - Static files load quickly
- **Secure** - No server-side processing means fewer vulnerabilities
- **Easy to maintain** - Content is written in Markdown
- **Free to host** - GitHub Pages provides free hosting

## What to Expect

I'll be sharing:

1. **Technical tutorials** - Practical guides on web development
2. **Project updates** - News about what I'm building
3. **Thoughts and insights** - Reflections on technology and development

## The Tech Stack

Here's what powers this site:

```yaml
# _config.yml
markdown: kramdown
plugins: []  # Zero plugins for maximum compatibility
```

The site uses:

- Jekyll for static site generation
- Kramdown for Markdown processing
- CSS Variables for theming
- Semantic HTML5 for accessibility

## Stay Connected
