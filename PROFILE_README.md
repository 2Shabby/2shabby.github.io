Building tools that run locally, interrupt gracefully, and don't hallucinate.

#### What I'm Working On

**[Jeeves Runtime](https://github.com/Jeeves-Cluster-Organization/jeeves-core)** — An agentic runtime that can pause mid-task, checkpoint to Postgres, and resume later. Go handles orchestration; Python handles LLM calls; gRPC connects them.

**[Code Analysis](https://github.com/Jeeves-Cluster-Organization/jeeves-capability-code-analysis)** — Agents explore codebases without making things up. A Critic agent validates every citation and triggers retries when something doesn't check out.

**[Voice on the Edge](https://github.com/Jeeves-Cluster-Organization/voice_radxa_gateway)** — Wake word to speech synthesis, all on a Radxa Rock 5. No cloud round-trips. Optional NPU acceleration if you want it faster.

**[Energy Monitoring](https://github.com/2Shabby/ESW)** — ESP32 talks Modbus to industrial power meters; Django makes sense of the data.

#### Past Research

**[Quantum State Generation](https://github.com/2Shabby/broadcastability_ml_project)** — Training GANs to output valid density matrices. Cholesky decomposition bakes in the physics constraints.

**[Witness Learning](https://github.com/Jeeves-Cluster-Organization/ML_QML_Witness_Generation)** — Can you certify entanglement with fewer measurements? Turns out SVMs and Transformers have opinions.
